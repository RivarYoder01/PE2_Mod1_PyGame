## Written by: Rivar Yoder and Andrew Hunhoff
The user is presented with music and a menu to choose the level of difficulty, an option to start the game, and an option to quit

The user gets a circle they must navigate to find a hidden circle. Their circle will change between red and blue depending on if they are moving closer or further away from the hidden circle

There is a debug key (d) that turns the hidden circle visible (White) and a reset key (r) that relocates the hidden
circle

The game is won when the user puts their circle close enough to the hidden circle that they overlap

Functions in order OF USE:
    main()
    set_difficulty()
    play_music()
    play_game()
    rand_location()
    game_stats()
    set_circle_color
